###Basic information
name : Roberto Alvarez
age : 50
occupation : Independent Coffee Shop Owner
background : Family-owned café operator for 15 years; just introduced a small catering service.
pain_points : 
1. Juggling inventory checks, catering orders, staff schedules, and customer feedback on paper.
2. Wastes hours each evening reconciling paper logs with digital spreadsheets.
3. Struggles to spot demand trends or predict supply needs.
goals :
1. Quickly capture daily sales, inventory counts, and new orders in one place.
2. Generate end-of-day summaries without manual data entry.
3. Anticipate busiest menu items to avoid shortages. 
context : A sudden lunch-rush catering order arrives just as he’s closing the shop for a break time; he scribbles notes on a receipt, then forgets key details by night’s end.
scenario : Back home, Roberto finds receipts scattered across the kitchen counter and spends two hours typing them into three separate spreadsheets(daily sales, inventory counts, new orders)—by which time he’s too exhausted to plan tomorrow’s prep.
experience to redesign : How can we redesign the experience of manually recording the sales and stocks that drains time and lead to frustration?
