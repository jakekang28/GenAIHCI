###Basic information
name : Roberto Alvarez
age : 50
occupation : Independent Coffee Shop Owner
background : Family-owned caf√© operator for 15 years; just introduced a small catering service.
pain_points : 
1. Juggling inventory checks, catering orders, staff schedules, and customer feedback on paper.
2. Wastes hours each evening reconciling paper logs with digital spreadsheets.
3. Struggles to spot demand trends or predict supply needs.
goals :
1. Quickly capture daily sales, inventory counts, and new orders in one place.
2. Generate end-of-day summaries without manual data entry.
3. Anticipate busiest menu items to avoid shortages. 
context : Roberto operates a small neighborhood coffee shop that has been in his family for two generations. Recently, he expanded into catering services to increase revenue, but this has doubled his administrative workload. He manages inventory, staff scheduling, customer orders, and financial tracking using a mix of paper records, basic spreadsheets, and a simple POS system that don't communicate with each other.
scenario : Roberto sits at his kitchen table at 11 PM, surrounded by crumpled receipts and sticky notes, manually entering yesterday's sales data into three different spreadsheets while his wife asks when he'll come to bed.
experience to redesign : How can we make tracking daily sales and inventory less time-consuming and frustrating?
