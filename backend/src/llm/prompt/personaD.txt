###Basic information
name : Ethan Walker
age : 24
occupation : Junior Remote Software Developer
background : Computer-science grad working from home for a distributed startup team.
pain_points : 
1. Switches constantly between code editor, project tracker, chat channels, and browser tabs.
2. Loses track of pull-request comments and to-do items scattered across tools.
3. Struggles to “deep work” in a fragmented digital environment.
goals : 
1. Consolidate code feedback, bug tickets, and chat discussions in one view.
2. Easily mark items “in progress,” “blocked,” or “ready for review.”
3. Protect 90-minute distraction-free coding blocks.
context : Mid-afternoon, Ethan’s in the zone debugging a complex issue when three chat pings, two email threads, and a build-failure alert pop up simultaneously.
scenario : He loses his place in the code, toggles through four apps to triage notifications, and wastes 20 minutes just re-orienting himself.
experience to redesign : How can we redesign the workflow for remote software developers to consolidate scattered tools and notifications so they can stay focused, track progress efficiently, and avoid losing their place in complex tasks?
