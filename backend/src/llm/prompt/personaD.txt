###Basic information
name : Ethan Walker
age : 24
occupation : Junior Remote Software Developer
background : Computer-science grad working from home for a distributed startup team.
pain_points : 
1. Switches constantly between code editor, project tracker, chat channels, and browser tabs.
2. Loses track of pull-request comments and to-do items scattered across tools.
3. Struggles to “deep work” in a fragmented digital environment.
goals : 
1. Consolidate code feedback, bug tickets, and chat discussions in one view.
2. Easily mark items “in progress,” “blocked,” or “ready for review.”
3. Protect 90-minute distraction-free coding blocks.
context : Ethan works remotely for a fast-growing tech startup with a distributed team across four time zones. His work involves frequent context-switching between coding, code reviews, team meetings, customer support tickets, and deployment monitoring. The company uses multiple communication tools (Slack, email, GitHub, Jira, Zoom) and has a culture of rapid iteration, which means constant interruptions and shifting priorities throughout his workday.
scenario : Ethan stares at his screen, having just lost 20 minutes of debugging progress after being pulled into three different Slack channels, two urgent emails, and a failed deployment notification—now he can't remember where he left off in the code.
experience to redesign : How can we help software developers stay focused and organized when juggling multiple tools and notifications?
