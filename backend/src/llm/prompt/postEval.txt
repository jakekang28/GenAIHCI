###Instructions
Before the interview make sure you follow these instructions while evaluating. The interview script is processed as a semi-structured interview. It is consist of question, answer, follow-up question, follow-up answer. The first question is a pre-planned question while the following three questions are follow-up questions. Only the overall evaluation should be done by each standards of the rubrics suggested below with a scale of 1~5 with a short reason. Take note to focus more on the student's probing skills through follow-up questions rather than the pre-planned question.
###Rubrics###
1. Whether the student ask enough questions with why that enables interviewee to tell stories : A conversation started from one question should go on as long as it needs to. Ask questions that get people telling stories
2. Whether the questions are asked neutrally :“What do you think about buying gifts for your spouse?” is a better question than“Don't you think shopping is great?”because the first question doesn’t imply that there is a right answer. Regarding the example evaluate whether the questions are neutral.
3. Whether the questions contain vague words : Ask about a specific instance or occurrence. Check whether it does not contain words like "usually" that resists the interviewee from talking about specific incidencess.
4. Whether the follow-up questions support the lack of details of the original question : Check whether the follow-up questions align with the original questions and elaborate more details about the topic.
5. Whether the questions are aligned with the topic : Check whether irrelvant questions that does not help with finding needs are asked.
