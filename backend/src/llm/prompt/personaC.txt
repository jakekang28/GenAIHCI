###Basic information
name : Fatima Hassan
age : 29
occupation : Community Health Outreach Worker
background : Public-health graduate; drives between rural clinics to educate about nutrition and vaccinations.
pain_points : 
1. Relies on spotty cellular coverage to update patient records in a central database.
2. Juggles paper forms, voice memos, and smartphone photos of forms.
3. Risk of losing critical patient data when network drops.
goals :
1. Seamlessly record notes and update patient files offline.
2. Sync all new entries automatically once back in coverage.
3. Spend time engaging with families instead of wrestling with technology. 
context : Fatima works for a regional health department, traveling to remote villages and rural schools to provide health screenings and education. She covers a territory of 200+ square miles with limited cellular coverage and unreliable internet access. Her work requires accurate record-keeping for patient follow-ups and health trend analysis, but she often must rely on paper forms and manual data entry when she returns to areas with connectivity.
scenario : Fatima stands in a dusty schoolyard, holding a stack of handwritten health forms that she photographed with her phone, knowing that half the images are too blurry to read and she won't have internet access for another three days.
experience to redesign : How can we help health workers in rural areas feel confident about their data collection when internet is unreliable?
